# VS Code Explains Episode 3 - LINQ in C#

## About this project
This is a basic .NET console app that queries sample Student and Grade data. Follow along with the corresponding YouTube video to understand what the queries do, fix a bug in the code, and generate a unit test.

To run the project, in the terminal, run the command `dotnet run`

## What is LINQ?
LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a feature in C# that allows you to query data from different data sources such as arrays, collections, databases, and XML files using a syntax similar to SQL. It provides a consistent way to query data regardless of the data source. This can make your code more readable and maintainable. Additionally, LINQ can improve performance by allowing you to filter and sort data on the server side before returning it to your application.
